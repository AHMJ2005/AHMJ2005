Great! Let‚Äôs break down the **Unix/Linux file permissions** system in full, so you understand what the `-`, `r`, `w`, and `x` mean ‚Äî **what they do**, and **when to use them**.

## üß± File Permission Structure

In Linux, file permissions are displayed like this:

```bash
-rwxr-xr--
```

It has **10 characters**:

```
[1] [2-4][5-7][8-10]
 ^    ^     ^     ^
 |    |     |     ‚îî‚îÄ Others (everyone else)
 |    |     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Group (your group)
 |    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ User (owner of file)
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ File type
```

## üî¢ \[1] File Type

The first character tells you **what kind of file it is**:

| Character | Meaning           |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| `-`       | Regular file      |
| `d`       | Directory         |
| `l`       | Symbolic link     |
| `c`       | Character device  |
| `b`       | Block device      |
| `s`       | Socket            |
| `p`       | Named pipe (FIFO) |

---

## üî§ \[2-10] Permissions (`r`, `w`, `x`)

Each of the next 9 characters comes in **3 groups** of 3:

| Section | Represents | Example (`rwx`) | Meaning           |
| ------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| 2‚Äì4     | **User**   | `rwx`           | Owner permissions |
| 5‚Äì7     | **Group**  | `r-x`           | Group permissions |
| 8‚Äì10    | **Others** | `r--`           | Everyone else     |

Each group can have these characters:

| Char | Meaning                   | When to Use                                        |
| ---- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `r`  | **Read** (view/read file) | Needed to open/read files or list directories      |
| `w`  | **Write** (modify file)   | Needed to edit or delete file contents             |
| `x`  | **Execute** (run file)    | Needed to **run scripts** or **enter directories** |

## üéØ When to Use `r`, `w`, and `x`

### ‚úÖ `r` (Read)

* For **files**: lets the user **open and read** contents.
* For **directories**: lets the user **see filenames** (but not contents).

### ‚úÖ `w` (Write)

* For **files**: lets the user **edit or overwrite** file contents.
* For **directories**: allows **creating, deleting, or renaming** files in the directory.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You need `x` on a directory **in addition** to `w` to fully work with it.

### ‚úÖ `x` (Execute)

* For **files**: lets the user **run the file** (like a script or program).
* For **directories**: allows the user to **enter (cd into)** the directory.

---

## üìÅ Examples

### `-rwxr-xr--`

* Owner: read, write, execute ‚Üí full control.
* Group: read and execute ‚Üí can view and run.
* Others: read-only ‚Üí can only see the file.

### `-rw-r--r--`

* Owner: read, write ‚Üí can edit.
* Group & Others: read-only ‚Üí can view only.

### `drwxr-x---`

* A **directory**:

  * Owner: full access.
  * Group: read and enter.
  * Others: no access.

## üõ†Ô∏è Changing Permissions (with `chmod`)

```bash
chmod u+x script.sh    # Add execute for user
chmod g-w file.txt     # Remove write for group
chmod o+r file.txt     # Add read for others
chmod 755 file.sh      # rwxr-xr-x (common for scripts)
```

## üß† Summary Table

| Symbol | File             | Directory               |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| `r`    | Can read file    | Can list directory      |
| `w`    | Can modify file  | Can add/remove files    |
| `x`    | Can execute file | Can `cd` into directory |
